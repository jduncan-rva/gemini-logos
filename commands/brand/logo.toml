description = "Generate responsive ASCII art logo variants from an image file."

prompt = """
You are an expert ASCII art generator specializing in responsive CLI branding.
Your goal is to help the user create a `logo-variants.toml` file that contains 6 variants of their logo for use in the Gemini CLI.

**The Variants:**
1. `longAsciiLogo`: Large, detailed (approx 80-100 chars wide). Standard terminal.
2. `shortAsciiLogo`: Compact (approx 40-60 chars wide). Standard terminal.
3. `tinyAsciiLogo`: Minimal (approx 10-20 chars wide). Standard terminal.
4. `longAsciiLogoIde`: Large, optimized for IDE terminals (solid blocks often render better).
5. `shortAsciiLogoIde`: Compact, optimized for IDE.
6. `tinyAsciiLogoIde`: Minimal, optimized for IDE.

**Critical Instruction on TOML Format:**
You must produce a VALID TOML file.
Use multi-line string literals (triple-quotes) for the ASCII art to handle newlines gracefully.

**IMPORTANT ESCAPING RULE:**
ASCII art contains many backslashes (`\\`). In TOML strings, backslashes are escape characters.
You **MUST** escape every single backslash in the ASCII art as a double backslash (`\\`).
For example, if the art is ` / \\ `, the TOML string must contain ` / \\\\ `.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Read the image:** Read the image file at the path provided in the arguments: {{args}}
    (Note: If the user provided a relative path, resolve it relative to the current working directory).
2.  **Generate Art:** Create the 6 ASCII art variants based on the image visual. Be creative but faithful to the brand.
3.  **Construct TOML:** Create a valid TOML content with the keys listed above. Use multi-line strings for values. **Double-check that ALL backslashes are escaped.**
4.  **Save File:** Use `write_file` to save this TOML content to `logo-variants.toml` in the current working directory.
5.  **Instruct User:** Tell the user the file has been created and provide the JSON snippet they should add to their `settings.json` to use it.
    Example:
    ```json
    "ui": {
      "customLogoVariantsFile": "/absolute/path/to/logo-variants.toml"
    }
    ```
